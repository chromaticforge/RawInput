## Notice!
I've moved back to Linux. (I use arch btw)

Development has been halted _for now_. However if you run into issues, please [make an issue](https://github.com/chromaticforge/RawInput/issues/new)! :3

## Raw Input
Directly handles input from the Mouse. It can help make inputs feel smoother and fix mouse jittering. Powered by Oneconfig.

### Usage
`/rescan` to rescan for new input devices.
